# Linux agent integration tests — the fake-game harness.
#
# Covers the whole Phase 2 path with no Steam, no Proton, no GPU and no Steam Deck:
#   * shortcuts.vdf discovery, including the signed -> unsigned AppID trap
#   * Proton prefix resolution (manifest tokens resolving INSIDE the prefix)
#   * both save shapes: in-prefix AND portable-next-to-the-exe
#   * Heroic Games Launcher: its own library files, its own prefixes — proton-shaped AND
#     wine-shaped — and the double-listing when a Heroic game is also added to Steam
#   * the launch wrapper: pull on launch, supervise the child, settle, push on exit
#   * the settle gate waiting out a game that flushes after it exits
#   * the /proc lock probe seeing a held write descriptor
#   * doctor's diagnostics: the right state root under --config, and an unenrolled machine
#     reported as an enrolment problem rather than a network one
#   * autostart reporting systemctl's real exit status
#
# MUST be run from a Linux filesystem (~/), never /mnt/c: DrvFs breaks inotify, permissions,
# case-sensitivity and locking, so a green run there would be a fiction.
