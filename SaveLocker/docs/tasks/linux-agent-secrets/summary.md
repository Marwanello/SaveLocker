# Linux agent secret permissions and state layout — summary

Seeded 2026-09-08 from `docs/Backlog.md` during the vault reorg (`chore/vault-docs-reorg`). No plan file exists yet — this is the backlog entry verbatim, kept as the starting point for a future `plan.md`.

- **Linux agent secret permissions and state layout.** `config.json` contains a long-lived machine key; file privacy depends on the launching shell's umask. Enforce `0700` on private state directories and `0600` on config, queue, health, and log files in code, including CLI enrollment paths. Consider separating immutable app files from mutable XDG config/state so upgrades cannot overlap the executable tree.
