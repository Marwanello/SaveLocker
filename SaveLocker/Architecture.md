```

Hub-and-spoke (not peer-to-peer). See `Decisions.md` for why unRAID is the keystone. The Windows
agent (`src/Agent`) and Linux agent (`src/Agent.Linux`) both host the shared sync brain in
`src/Agent.Core` — see [[REPO_MAP]] for the full module layout.

## Components

### Shared (`src/Shared`)
- `Contracts.cs` — wire DTOs (records) used by both server and agent.
- `SaveArchive.cs` — deterministic content hashing of a save dir + zip create / **atomic restore** (staging dir → swap → rollback on failure).
- `ManifestLoader.cs` — downloads/caches the Ludusavi manifest (YAML), resolves a game's save dirs. `PathResolver.cs` — expands Windows path tokens (`<winAppData>`, `<winLocalAppDataLow>`, `<winSavedGames>`, `<winDocuments>`, …) and trims at the first wildcard to a concrete directory.

### Server (`src/Server`)
- `Program.cs` — minimal-API endpoints + DI. Schema via `db.Database.Migrate()` on startup; a bootstrap shim pre-stamps `InitialSchema` on existing DBs so `Migrate()` skips it. Two auth filter groups: `ApiKeyFilter` (agent routes, `X-Api-Key`) and `AdminPasswordFilter` (dashboard routes, `X-Admin-Password` when a password is set).
- `Data/Entities.cs`, `Data/AppDbContext.cs` — EF Core model. ⚠️ See `Gotchas.md` about the `Data/` vs `data/` folder collision.
- `Services/SyncService.cs` — all orchestration logic (registration, leasing, conflict-aware upload, download, resolve, rollback, **version pruning**).
- `Services/ArchiveStore.cs` — archive files on disk: `{root}/{gameId}/{versionId}.zip`.
- `Services/BackupService.cs` — nightly SQLite snapshots (`BackupScheduler` + `VACUUM INTO`, WAL-safe) with retention; the DB is the version graph, so it has its own on-box backup (`/data/backups`). See `API Reference.md`.
- `Services/AgentInstallerService.cs` — stores the agent installer binary on disk (`Storage:AgentInstallerRoot`, default `data/agent-installer/`) with a sidecar `installer-info.json`. `GET /api/agent/latest` checks here first; admin endpoints let the dashboard upload/delete/stream the installer. See **Agent auto-update** below.
- `Services/AgentInstallerPollerService.cs` — optional `BackgroundService` that checks the configured GitHub release at the dashboard-managed `AgentUpdate:AutoFetchHours` interval and refreshes the hosted installer only when a newer release is available.
- `Services/LeaseSweeperService.cs` — `BackgroundService` that runs hourly via `IServiceScopeFactory` and sweeps leases where `ExpiresAt < UtcNow`.
- `Services/SettingsService.cs` — DB-backed key/value store (`AppSetting` entity). DB value overrides `IConfiguration` (appsettings/env); used for SteamGridDB key, admin password hash, and installer auto-fetch interval.
- **OpenAPI** — `AddOpenApi()`/`MapOpenApi()` serve `/openapi/v1.json`; Swagger UI at `/swagger`. The web dashboard's types are generated from this doc (`openapi-typescript` → `web/src/api-types.ts`).
- **Dashboard** — React `web/` SPA. Docker `web` build stage copies `dist/` into `src/Server/wwwroot/`. Its `types.ts` is generated from the server's OpenAPI doc, so it can't drift from the DTOs.

### Agent.Core (`src/Agent.Core`)
The platform-neutral sync brain, shared by the Windows tray and the Linux daemon.
- `SyncEngine.cs` — push/pull/pre-launch/post-exit; per-game cross-process `flock` + in-process
  lock together (`Decisions.md` §8).
- `SaveSettler.cs` — settle gate before an automatic push; `FileLockProbe.cs` backs it
  (`FileShare` on Windows, `/proc/*/fd` on Linux).
- `ApiClient.cs` / `ServerTrust.cs` — typed HTTP client + TOFU pin of the server's TLS key.
- `LeaseWarningStore.cs` — durable `lease-warnings.json` beside the config; needed because the
  Linux launch wrapper is a separate short-lived process from the daemon, so an in-memory warning
  never reached any UI (24 h expiry).
- `AgentApiServer.cs` — loopback-only local management API on `:5178`, token-authenticated
  (`Decisions.md` §7).
- `Watchers.cs`, `CommandPoller.cs`, `OfflineQueue(Drainer).cs`, `Enroller.cs`, `SteamVdf.cs`,
  `SteamShortcuts.cs` — discovery, reconciliation, offline retry, enrollment.
- `Platform.cs` (`IAutoStart`, `IGameScanner`) — the seam each host implements.

### Agent (`src/Agent`)
- `Program.cs` — entry point: no args → tray (`TrayApp.cs`); args → CLI commands.
- `TrayApp.cs` — tray icon + menu, engine/poller lifecycle, update-check startup + 24 h timer.
- `AgentApiServer.cs` — ASP.NET Core minimal API on **localhost:5178** (loopback only, never LAN). Serves static `agent-ui/dist/` files (SPA fallback) and JSON API routes for the React agent UI. Every `/api/*` call requires the local token from `{configDir}/api-token`, which is injected into `index.html` when the SPA shell is served; Host and Origin are validated to defeat DNS rebinding. It is a *management* API — see `Decisions.md` §7.
- `AgentWindow.cs` — WinForms form hosting WebView2. Hides instead of closing (re-showable from tray). DPI-scaled `ClientSize` (see `Gotchas.md`).
- `SyncEngine.cs` — push (archive→hash→upload), pull (download→restore), pre-launch (lease + pull), post-exit (push + release).
- `UpdateChecker.cs` — polls `GET /api/agent/latest`, compares with `Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().GetName().Version`, respects `AgentConfig.SkipVersion`. Downloads installer to `%TEMP%`, launches with `/SILENT /FORCECLOSEAPPLICATIONS /NORESTART`.
- `CommandPoller.cs` — 20 s poll: (1) reconcile game list (adopt new server games, drop deleted ones); (2) run queued pull/push/sync/scan commands and report results.
- `ApiClient.cs` — typed HTTP client. `Detection.cs` — Ludusavi manifest wrapper.
- `Watchers.cs` — debounced `FileSystemWatcher` + process poll (`ProcessWatcher`).
- `SaveSettler.cs` — settle gate for **automatic** pushes (process-exit, folder-watch). A process exit does not mean the save is on disk, so before archiving it waits for the save folder to hold a stable fingerprint (file set + sizes + write times) with nothing open for writing, for `SettleQuietSeconds` (default 10, set in agent Settings → Sync Safety), capped by `SettleMaxWaitSeconds` (120) after which the push proceeds anyway. Manual/CLI pushes skip the gate. `PushAsync` serialises per game, since the folder watcher can fire while the exit push is still settling.
- `OfflineQueue.cs` / `OfflineQueueDrainer.cs` — `PushAsync` enqueues to `%PROGRAMDATA%\SaveLocker\offline-queue.json` on `HttpRequestException`; 30 s drain timer retries when the server is reachable.
- `AgentConfig.cs` — JSON config at `%PROGRAMDATA%\SaveLocker\config.json`. Tracks `SkipVersion` + `LastUpdateCheck` for update-check cooldown.

### Linux agent (`src/Agent.Linux`) — binary `savelocker`
Headless Proton-game agent; no tray, no toast. Scope is deliberately non-Steam Windows games run
under Proton (`Decisions.md`), discovered via `shortcuts.vdf`.
- `Program.cs` — `daemon` / `run` / `doctor` / `autostart`, else falls through to `AgentCli`.
- `Daemon.cs` — headless host: `AgentApiServer` + `CommandPoller` + `OfflineQueueDrainer` +
  folder watchers, all long-lived and holding `AgentConfig` in memory (the reason §8/§10 exist).
- `ProtonRun.cs` — `savelocker run -- %command%`, the Steam launch wrapper: reads
  `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH`/`SteamAppId`, pulls before launch, pushes after exit.
- `LinuxGameScanner.cs` / `SteamRoots.cs` — `IGameScanner` + native/Flatpak Steam root + compatdata
  resolution.
- `Doctor.cs` — end-to-end diagnostic chain; the only UI a headless Deck install has outside the
  Game Mode UI.
- `SystemdAutoStart.cs` — `IAutoStart` via `systemd --user`.
- `Ui/` — **`savelocker ui`**, the Game Mode-only gamepad surface (SDL + OpenGL + Dear ImGui), for
  when there is no browser to reach `:5178` from. Four screens (Status / Add game / Set save
  folder / Steam launch setup) call `Agent.Core` in-process — it is a view, not a second frontend.
  `Theme.cs` mirrors `web/src/index.css` so palette/type match the React UI. `Widgets.cs` paints
  gamepad-navigable components over `InvisibleButton`; `Icons.cs` draws the lucide glyph set as
  vector paths. `Gallery.cs`/`Screenshot.cs` back the WSLg dev loop (`tests/linux/run-ui-wslg.sh`).
  See `Decisions.md` and `Gotchas.md` for the ImGui-specific traps hit building this.

## Agent auto-update (Windows only)
Versioning is **MinVer** (git-tag-driven). Tag `v0.1.0` → that build stamps `0.1.0` in all assembly version fields. Between tags → `0.1.0-alpha.N+hash`.

**Release flow:**
1. `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`
2. `release.yml` builds on `windows-latest`, runs `build-installer.ps1`, creates a GitHub Release with the exe attached.
3. Admin uploads the installer in dashboard → Configuration → Agent Updates (`POST /api/admin/agent-installer`).
4. Connected agents check within 24 h (or via tray "Check for Updates"); offered update via balloon → confirm dialog (Update Now / Skip / Remind Later).
5. Agent downloads from `GET /api/agent/installer/download`, launches silently, exits.

**Linux/Deck has no auto-update channel yet** — users re-run `install.sh` from a newer tarball
(open backlog item, see `Backlog.md`).

## Conflict model (the safety mechanism)
On upload the agent sends the version it last knew (`parent`):
- `parent == server head` → **fast-forward** (new head).
- Incoming content hash `== head` → **no-op**.
- Head moved on → **conflict** recorded; head untouched; admin resolves.

Leases prevent most conflicts up front; hashing/lineage is the safety net.

**Conflict pressure is capped, not infinite.** The first three rejected payloads on a game
preserve real divergent history; after that, further pushes report the conflict without
re-uploading bytes. A conflict overdue past **6 hours** is surfaced on every heartbeat so a
connected Windows tray can notify the user even when the stuck machine is a headless Deck.
**"Keep both"** doesn't fork into two heads: the chosen snapshot becomes the sole Latest, and
both conflicting snapshots get `SaveVersion.Protected` (exempt from retention) until an admin
explicitly unprotects them. Resolution refuses to promote anything older than the current head.

**Resolving a conflict in the console only edits a row** — it does not tell the agent anything.
A machine's local parent only advances on its own successful push or pull; a stuck agent needs a
guarded pull (safe: it short-circuits before any file write when content already matches head) —
use the CLI (`savelocker pull`, `force: false` by default) rather than the console's Pull button,
which sends `force: true` and bypasses the unpushed-changes guard.

## Data model (SQLite via EF Core)
EF-managed entities: `Machine`, `Game` (holds `HeadVersionId`), `SaveVersion` (parent chain +
`ContentHash`; `Protected` exempts a snapshot from automatic retention), `Lease` (one per game,
unique index), `ConflictFlag`, `AuditLog`, `AgentCommand`, `AppSetting` (key/value store),
`MachineSavePath` (composite key `(MachineId, GameId)` → a machine's stored save folder for a game).

> **"Latest" = the head.** `Game.HeadVersionId` is the authoritative version agents pull; the dashboard labels it **Latest**; the admin action to set it is **"Set as Latest"**.

### Rules the console bug bounty settled (2026-07-27)
Each of these is a *durability or delivery* property rather than a feature; the "why" is in
`Decisions.md`, the traps in `Gotchas.md`.

- **`SaveVersion.MachineId` is nullable, `ON DELETE SET NULL`**, beside a `MachineName` snapshot
  taken at upload. Save history outlives the machine that produced it — deleting a machine used to
  cascade through every version it uploaded. `DeleteMachineAsync` detaches the rows explicitly
  rather than relying on the FK.
- **Head moves in exactly one place** (`SyncService.SetHeadAndPropagateAsync`). Where the *server*
  decided — automatic policy, manual resolution, rollback, Set as Latest — it queues a deduplicated
  **unforced** Pull for every live machine that syncs the game. An ordinary push does not fan out.
- **`AgentCommand` delivery is a visibility lease**, not a one-way `Dispatched`: `LeaseExpiresAt` +
  `ClaimToken` + `ClaimCount`, claimed by one atomic UPDATE. At-least-once, which is safe because
  every command type is safe to repeat.
- **Files are staged then published; rows are deleted before files.** Save archives land in
  `{ArchiveRoot}/.incoming/*.part` and the hosted installer in `{AgentInstallerRoot}/.incoming-*`;
  both publish by rename, both are swept at startup. Deletion commits the database first, because an
  orphaned file is recoverable and a live row with no archive is not.
- **Lease writes are single conditional statements**, so two machines launching together produce one
  winner and one ordinary `Granted=false` instead of a 500. `ActiveLeaseAsync` is a pure read.
- **URLs handed to other machines come from `PublicUrl.For`** — `Server:PublicBaseUrl`, else the
  request origin — and an *inferred* loopback address refuses to mint an enrollment file.
- **Credentials commit only on success:** the SteamGridDB key is verified before it replaces the
  stored one, and enrollment burns its token inside the same transaction that issues the machine key.

## Retention
After a successful upload, `SyncService.PruneVersionsAsync` keeps the newest
`Storage:RetainVersionsPerGame` (default 10) per game, deleting older archives. Never prunes the
head, versions referenced by an open conflict, or versions explicitly protected by an admin.
Per-game override: `Game.RetainVersions` (nullable — null uses global default; 0 = unlimited).
