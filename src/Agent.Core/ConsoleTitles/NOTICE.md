# console-titles.tsv.gz — data notice

`console-titles.tsv.gz` (game serial → title for PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, GameCube and Wii) is
adapted from the Redump dats in [libretro-database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/tree/fbeefcb46c2e1b20a7e2945f34a694a41b2d6f90/metadat/redump)

Changes: only each disc's serial and name are kept; the name loses its language list, revision, disc number and
EDC tags; one name is kept per serial (a retail disc's over a demo's, then the shortest).

This file, as adapted, is shared under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 license. That license covers this data file only —
not SaveLocker's code, which reads it as data and is licensed under the repository's `LICENSE`.
