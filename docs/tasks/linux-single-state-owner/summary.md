# One state owner for the Linux agent (deferred) — summary

Seeded 2026-09-08 from `docs/Backlog.md` during the vault reorg (`chore/vault-docs-reorg`). No plan file exists yet — this is the backlog entry verbatim, kept as the starting point for a future `plan.md`.

- **Deferred: one state owner for the Linux agent** — wrapper→daemon IPC over a Unix socket, standalone fallback when no daemon is up. The locking in `Decisions.md` §8 makes the current two-owner model *correct*; IPC would make it *simple*. Worth doing before the state files grow further.
