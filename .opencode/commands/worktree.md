description: Open a branch in a .claude/worktrees worktree
---

Registered worktrees:
!`git worktree list`

All branches:
!`git branch -a`

$ARGUMENTS

$ARGUMENTS is a branch name (e.g. `fix/tray-flicker`). If empty, ask which branch.
1. If the branch already has a worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, report its path and stop — never create a duplicate.
2. Otherwise create one: slugify the branch (`/` → `-`), then `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<slug> <branch>` for an existing branch, or add `-b <branch>` to create the branch. Confirm the path with the user first when no explicit name was given.
3. Fresh-worktree setup (the recurring gotcha): run `npm install` in BOTH `web/` and `agent-ui/` inside the new worktree — a missing `agent-ui/node_modules` silently breaks the agent build. Restore `src/Server` + `src/Agent.Linux` with dotnet, never the full sln (`src/Agent` targets net10.0-windows and cannot restore on Linux).
4. If `.claude/worktrees/` holds directories NOT listed by `git worktree list` (stale checkouts), report them and ask before pruning — never delete unprompted.
